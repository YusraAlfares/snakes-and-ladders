# Snakes and Ladders implementation

## Overview
This is an implementation of snakes and ladders game using Java, where I used Breadth First Search (BFS) to help with finding the shortest path.

## Course details 
This course talked about different topics of algorithms including BFS and DFS, heap and heap sort, different types of strategies to solve a problem like divide and conquer, and how to compute the Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta, and many more different topics.
